A keyboard case designed for the 5 column version of Corne v2 - may fit other versions prior to v4.

Apart from the case a 4.75 mm thick plate is included.

### Additional hardware
- 20x M2 screws (≥ 6 mm for top; ≥ 3.5 mm for bottom)
- 10x 5 mm  brass standoffs
- 20x 1 mm M2 silicone washers
- 8x 6 mm bumpons

The case is assembled by adding washers to the case and the plate before installing the screws. The USB cutout allows for some variation in standoff length as well as number of washers so feel free to experiment with how it affects typing feel.

Note that the case is designed for wireless; there are no cutouts for TRRS-jacks.
